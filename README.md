# [Backstabbers Production](http://b0221.com/backstabbers-react-test)

A full-stack website for the video production company 'Backstabbers Production'. Made with React front-end and PHP back-end. The front-end sends fetch requests to the back-end and the back-end makes use of the Vimeo API to request video data for the portfolio. Currently, the website is still a work in progress, but the necessary systems are all in place.
